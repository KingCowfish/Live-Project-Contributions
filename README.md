<h3>Introduction</h3>

<hr>

<p>My first foray into collaborative software development took place 
during my time at The Tech Academy when they had me work with my 
fellow students on a full scale MVC application in C#.  Not only was 
it a great opportunity to add features and fix bugs, but it was
also helpful in incrasing my confidence by teaching me that I am 
capable of this sort of work and in introducing me to software 
development on a professional level.

The two week sprint allowed each student to work on both front and 
back end stories for a employee management website for a construction
company.  During the week we would have daily standup meetings and
at the end of each week we would have a sprint retrospective. Due to 
my own personal time constraints, I focused a bit more on 
front end stories though I did complete one back end story that I 
am proud of.

Below are descriptions for the stories that I worked on, some before
and after photos of the front end stories, as well as some code
snippets for the back end story that I completed.

<h4>New User Button Alignment</h4>

<p>Aligned the buttons on the new user page so they show as a row instead of 
 a column. I also, made a small aesthetic change to one of the input labels.</p>
